  * Show each frame
  * Move to next frame by user input

#### Remove background
  * Use median filter or initial filter to find background
  * Subtract

#### Find apparanet motion
  * Solve for optical flow
  * Find longest continuous flow of movement
  * Find frame where velocity is zero

#### Spot position (optional, maybe to complicated)
  * Find the dot on the waterbottle
  * Find/read the measuring lines
